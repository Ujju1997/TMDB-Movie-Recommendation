## Introduction

The Movie Recommendation project aims to recommend movies to users. This is a content-based recommendation system.


## Problem aimed to solve

1. Organizations struggle with optimizing employee performance and retention due to a lack of data-driven insights. 
2. This project aims to create an HR Analysis Dashboard using Power BI, providing  HR professionals with actionable insights to optimize HR strategies, improve performance, and reduce attrition.

## Dataset

## Methodology

The following methodology was used to accomplish the project objectives:

1. **Data Loading:** The movie data was loaded from the CSV file into the Pandas dataframe. 


2. **Data Cleaning and Pre-processing:** The data cleaning process encompassed eliminating irrelevant data, addressing missing values, standardizing formats, removing duplicates, and applied NLP techniques like removing stopwords, punctuations, stemming to make the data useful for creating the vectorization matrix.

3. **Streamlit App:** A web-based app was built using Streamlit and python
